This project is a very crude implementation of a 4x4 K-map where you enter the minterms and the result is a minimized expression

Steps to run the code: 
1) First compile by using the makefile 
2) Run by typing in ./final


-- If you find any errors in the program do let me know, I've not tested it completely :P
